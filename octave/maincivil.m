/*!\mainpage Octave with Doxygen
 
 Here I generate Octave documentation with the Doxygen. Ealier I does not know about doxygen how to use it, so I start from doxygen with python . I generate documentation for python files and I face minor problems But solve them very quicky. But my work is to generate documentation for octave files, Hence I generate it.
